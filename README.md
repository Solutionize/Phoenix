# Phoenix ERP



### To-do:

* Orders section needs some love. It was a low business priority and hence, even though there is a model and code hanging around, it may not be working properly.
* Move admin panel to core app and get rid of Rails Admin and CanCanCan gems. Rails Admin is good to use during initial phases of the App.
* Remove hard-coded values in code which were used for interim use during live events. Once multi-location operations is enabled, user authorisation should define access.
