# Phoenix ERP


To-do:
- Orders section needs some love. It was a low business priority and hence, even though there is a model and code hanging around, it may not be working properly.
- Move admin panel to core app and get rid of Rails Admin and CanCanCan gems. Rails Admin is good to use during initial phases of the App.
- Remove hard-coded values in code which were used for interim use by HQ. Once it is rolled-out to business associates, these should be fetched based on logged in user's rights.
